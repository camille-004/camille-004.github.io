So, I decided to code my own website over continuing with that WordPress template.

## To-Do:
- [ ] Add ajax pages for all portfolio items
- [ ] Create blog page
  - [ ] Upload to blog
- [ ] Maybe change that picture? I look kind of mean. o_o
- [ ] Change grammar in Additional Skills
- [ ] Maybe get a new domain name
