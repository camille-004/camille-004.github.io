                      <p class="drop-cap">
                        In Data Science, big, messy problem sets are
                        unavoidable. If we keep them as such, every step of the
                        analytical process will be much more cumbersome. Given
                        this, it’s inarguable that we would want a way to view
                        our data at large in a logical and organized manner.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Clustering is one of the most popular methods in data
                        science and is an unsupervised Machine Learning
                        technique that enables us to find structures within our
                        data, without trying to obtain specific insight. In
                        cluster analysis, we partition our dataset into groups
                        that share similar attributes. The math blog, Eureka!,
                        put it nicely: we want to assign our data points to
                        clusters such that there is “high intra-cluster
                        similarity” and “low inter-cluster similarity.” Here are
                        some examples of real-life applications of clustering.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        One example is in the marketing industry. Clustering
                        algorithms have proven to be effective in producing what
                        they call “market segments” in market research. For each
                        market segment, a business may have different criteria
                        for catering to their needs and effectively marketing
                        their product or service.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        For example, when plotting customer satisfaction (CSAT)
                        score and customer loyalty (Figure 1), clustering can be
                        used to segment the data into subgroups, from which we
                        can get pretty unexpected results that may stimulate
                        experiments and further analysis. In this case, we
                        attained a whole cluster of customers who are loyal but
                        have low CSAT scores.
                      </p>

                        Clustering algorithms — particularly <em>k</em>-means
                        (<em>k</em>=2) clustering– have also helped speed up
                        spam email classifiers and lower their memory usage.
                        They have also made headway in helping classify
                        different species of plants and animals, organizing of
                        assets, identifying frauds, and studying housing values
                        based on factors such as geographic location.

                      <p>
                        Let us proceed and discuss a significant method of
                        clustering called hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA).
                        This article will assume some familiarity with k-means
                        clustering, as the two strategies possess some
                        similarities, especially with regard to their iterative
                        approaches.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Hierarchical Clustering</h2>

                      <p class="drop-cap">
                        HCA is a strategy that seeks to build a
                        <strong>hierarchy</strong> of clusters that has an
                        established ordering from top to bottom.
                        <em>K</em>-means would not fall under this category as
                        it does not output clusters in a hierarchy, so let’s get
                        an idea of what we want to end up with when running one
                        of these algorithms. A “hierarchy of clusters” is
                        usually represented by a <strong>dendrogram</strong>,
                        shown below (Figure 2).
                      </p>

                      <!-- image aligncenter -->
                      <div class="wp-caption aligncenter">
                        <img src="images/blog/hca-blog/fig2.png" alt="Image" />
                        <p class="wp-caption-text">
                          Figure 2: Visual from Data Viz Project
                        </p>
                      </div>
                      <!-- image aligncenter -->

                      <p>
                        For instance, a dendrogram that describes scopes of
                        geographic locations might have a name of a country at
                        the top,, then it might point to its regions, which will
                        then point to their states/provinces, then counties or
                        districts, and so on.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        To create a dendrogram, we must compute the similarities
                        between the attributes. Note that to compute the
                        similarity of two features, we will usually be utilizing
                        the Manhattan distance or Euclidean distance. These
                        distances would be recorded in what is called a
                        <strong>proximity matrix</strong>, an example of which
                        is depicted below (Figure 3), which holds the distances
                        between each point. We would use those cells to find
                        pairs of points with the smallest distance and start
                        linking them together to create the dendrogram. I will
                        not be delving too much into the mathematical formulas
                        used to compute the distances between the two clusters,
                        but they are not too difficult and you can read about it

                      <p>
                        I will describe how a dendrogram is used to represent
                        HCA results in more detail later. For now, consider the
                        following heatmap of our example raw data. We will
                        assume this heat mapped data is numerical. In case you
                        aren’t familiar with heatmaps, the different colors
                        correspond to the magnitude of the numerical value of
                        each attribute in each sample. Light colors here, for
                        example, might correspond to middle values, dark orange
                        might represent high values, and dark blue might
                        represent lower values. Darker colors usually refer to
                        extreme values in a numerical dataset.
                      </p>

                      <!-- image aligncenter -->

                      <p>
                        We see that based on the patterns in each row, Attribute
                        #1 and Attribute #3 are similar. We will “cluster” them
                        as follows:
                      </p>

                      <!-- image aligncenter -->

                      </div>
                      <!-- image aligncenter -->

                      <p>
                        Now, we have a cluster for our first two similar
                        attributes, and we actually want to treat that as one
                        attribute. We now want to figure out which of Attribute
                        #2 and Attribute #4 are most similar to Cluster #1. We
                        then compare the three clusters, but we find that
                        Attribute #2 and Attribute #4 are actually the most
                        similar. Thus, we end up with the following:

                      <p>
                        Finally, since we now only have two clusters left, we
                        can merge them together to form one final,
                        all-encompassing cluster.

                      <p>
                        Now, here’s how we would summarize our findings in a
                        dendrogram.
                      </p>

                      <!-- image aligncenter -->
                      <div class="wp-caption aligncenter">
                        <img src="images/blog/hca-blog/ex5.png" alt="Image" />
                      </div>
                      <!-- image aligncenter -->

                      <p>
                        Notice the differences in the lengths of the three
                        branches. The original cluster we had at the top,
                        Cluster #1, displayed the most similarity and it was the
                        cluster that was formed first, so it will have the
                        shortest branch. Cluster #2 had the second most
                        similarity and was formed second, so it will have the
                        second shortest branch. The longest branch will belong
                        to the last Cluster #3 since it was formed last.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Hence, the dendrogram indicates both the similarity in
                        the clusters and the sequence in which they were formed,
                        and the lengths of the branches outline the hierarchical
                        and iterative nature of this algorithm. Under the hood,
                        we will be starting with <em>k</em>=<em>N</em> clusters,
                        and iterating through the sequence <em>N</em>,
                        <em>N</em>-1, <em>N</em>-2,…,1, as shown visually in the
                        dendrogram.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        There are two different approaches used in HCA:
                        <strong>agglomerative</strong> clustering and
                        <strong>divisive</strong> clustering.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering</h2>

                      <p class="drop-cap">
                        This is the more common out of the two approaches, and
                        essentially what I just described above. The process can
                        be summed up in this fashion:
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Start by assigning each point to an individual cluster.
                      </p>

                      </div>
                      <!-- image aligncenter -->

                      <p>
                        At each iteration, we’ll merge clusters together and
                        repeat until there is only one cluster left. In this
                        case, the light blue cluster is our last cluster and its
                        branch will be the longest and at the end on the
                        dendrogram.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Since each of our observations started in their own
                        clusters and we moved up the hierarchy by merging them
                        together, agglomerative HC is referred to as a
                        <strong>bottom-up</strong>
                        approach.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Divisive Hierarchical Clustering</h2>

                      <p>
                        A <strong>top-down</strong> procedure, divisive
                        hierarchical clustering works in reverse order. We start
                        with one cluster, and we recursively split our enveloped
                        features into separate clusters, moving down the
                        hierarchy until each cluster only contains one point.
                        The algorithm is along these lines:
                      </p>

                      <p>Assign all <em>N</em> of our points to one cluster.</p>

                      <!-- image aligncenter -->
                      <div class="wp-caption aligncenter">

                      </div>
                      <!-- image aligncenter -->

                      <p>
                        At each iteration, we will split the farthest data point
                        from the rest from this larger cluster and assign it to
                        its own.
                      </p>

                        This will continue until <em>N</em> singleton clusters
                        remain.

                      <h2>Takeaways</h2>

                      <p>
                        There are several advantages associated with using
                        hierarchical clustering: it shows all the possible links
                        between clusters, it helps us understand our data much
                        better, and while <em>k</em>-means presents us with the
                        luxury of having a “one-size-fits-all” methodology of
                        having to preset the number of clusters we want to end
                        up with, doing so is not necessary when using HCA.
                        However, a commonplace drawback of HCA is the lack of
                        scalability: imagine what a dendrogram will look like
                        with 1,000 vastly different observations, and how
                        computationally expensive producing it would be!
